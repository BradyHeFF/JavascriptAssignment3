                <p> Marshall Mathers, otherwise known as Eminem, is a hip-hop artist born in St. Joseph, Missouri and raised in Detroit, Michigan. 
                    He is one of the best-selling artists of the 21st century. Eminem had a rough upbringing; he was often forced to move towns by his single 
                    mother which caused him to change schools repeatedly. As a result, he had a tough time making new friends and suffered from frequent bullying. 
                    These times in his life are portrayed throughout his lyrics as he often raps about his difficult childhood and suffering from poverty 
                    in his music. Eminem has stated that he began rapping around the age of 14, but began taking it seriously at the age of 17. 
                    He released his first album in 1996 which was titled <em>Infinite</em>. Afterwards, Eminem released his second album 
                    called <em>Slim Shady LP</em> in 1997. Following the release of these albums and a second-place finish at the Rap Olympics in Las Angeles
                    in 1997, Eminem gained enough traction in the industry to be recognized by the famous rapper and producer Dr. Dre, who signed him to the
                    record label <em>Aftermath</em> in 1998.
